# MVC Calculator Professional
This is an advanced calculator that I developed in JAVA using the javax.swing & java.awt libraries. The infastructure of the program was based on the principles of an MVC (Modle View Controler) in order to have optimized and efficient code organization for high levels of functionality. The program uses a basic JFRAME GUI which allows the user to input their advanced calculations into various JTextFields in order to perform their complex mathematical equaitions. The interesting part of GUI developement with the javax.swing libraries is that all user interface development is text-based, so no visual development tools were used in the making of this software. This software has been approved to meet the Moradi Calculation Standards.
